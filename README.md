# CodingTest

My design ideas, According to the X and Y coordinatesï¼šthe direction is judged. The reverse direction of the X coordinate is west, the X coordinate is subtracted, the positive X is east, and the X coordinate is added.

The reverse direction of the Y coordinate is south, the Y coordinate is subtracted, the positive direction of Y is north, and the Y coordinate is added.

The  results of Testing

Position: X=1  Y=1 Orientation: EAST

Position: X=1  Y=2 Orientation: North

Position: X=2  Y=1 Orientation: East

java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException
	
Position: X=3  Y=1 Orientation: East
